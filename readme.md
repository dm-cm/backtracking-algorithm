## Info

This project uses Python 3.7.5 and object-oriented programming paradigm. It visualizes a UI maze with some options. Once the process is triggered, the maze resolution can be visualized through Backtracking algorithm.

Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to some computational problems that incrementally builds candidates to the solutions, and abandons a candidate ("backtracks") as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution.

## Usage

Be sure to install Tkinter first. On Linux:

        sudo apt-get install python3-tk

For other SO, please check: https://tkdocs.com/tutorial/install.html

Finally, run main:
